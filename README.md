## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 **M.S. in Computer Science @ The George Washington University** (Expected Dec 2025)  
- 🧠 TA / Grader for **Design & Analysis of Algorithms (CSCI 6212)**  
- 💼 Actively looking for roles in:
  - **Software Engineering**
  - **ML / AI Engineering**
  - **Data / Analytics Engineering**
  - **Cloud & Backend Engineering**
- 🧩 I love turning **course theory** (algorithms, ML, cloud, OOD) into **portfolio projects** that feel like real products.

Right now, I’m focused on building **production-style apps** with real APIs, databases, ML models, and dashboards that I can proudly show to recruiters and hiring managers.

## 📈 Highlight Projects

> These are the kinds of projects I want recruiters to notice first.

### 🔍 InfraSight – Cloud Cost Intelligence Platform
**Stack:** FastAPI · React + TS · PostgreSQL · Docker · AWS · scikit-learn  

- End-to-end **cloud cost optimizer** that analyzes AWS billing data.
- Backend: FastAPI APIs for **cleaned costs, forecasts, anomalies, clustering, and ML-based recommendations**.
- ML: KMeans clustering, anomaly detection, and per-service cost forecasting with confidence intervals.
- DB: **PostgreSQL** with async SQLAlchemy for logging and user auth.
- Frontend: React dashboard with:
  - Overview charts (top services, heatmaps, timelines)
  - Forecast & anomaly visualizations
  - Logs page with full CRUD and filters
  - Authentication (JWT, protected routes)
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow running pytest on every push/PR.

> _Goal: Showcase real-world skills for backend, ML, and full-stack roles._

### 🎵 MelodyHub – OOD-Driven Music & Chat Platform
**Stack:** Node.js · MongoDB · OOP / UML Design  

- Spotify-style **music streaming + chat** application.
- Designed using full **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - UML Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity, State, Component diagrams.
  - Clean separation into **Interface, Control, and Entity** layers.
- Features:
  - **Listeners**: stream music, create playlists, interact with Artists.
  - **Artists**: upload songs, manage content, engage with listeners.
- Used for an **OOD course final project** with a strong focus on UML and best practices.

> _Goal: Demonstrate solid OOP design, architecture, and maintainable backend structure._

### 🎙️ Audio Classification CNN – “Dog / Cat / Bird”
**Stack:** Python · Deep Learning (CNNs) · Mel-spectrograms  

- Built a complete pipeline that takes **1-second audio clips** of people saying “dog”, “cat”, or “bird”.
- Converted raw waveforms → **Mel-spectrograms** (2D images: frequency vs time).
- Trained several **CNN architectures** to classify the spectrograms.
- Explored:
  - Train/validation/test splits
  - Regularization (dropout, early stopping)
  - Model comparison and generalization

> _Goal: Show applied deep learning skills beyond standard image datasets._

---

### 🤝 Other Projects (In Progress / Planned)
- **VolunTier** – Hyper-local volunteer matching platform using geodata.
- **TalkifyDocs** – Chat with your documents SaaS concept.
- **QueryVault** – SQL performance tuning playground.
- **MoodMosaic** – AI-curated playlists from journaling text.
